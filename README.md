A Natural Language-Based Programming Interface for LLMs

The aim of Promethea is to facilitate a programming language tailored for machines, specifically designed to enable even low-capability Large Language Models (LLMs) to write and execute code that interacts with their environment. Drawing inspiration from Prometheus, who granted fire to humanity, this initiative seeks to empower AI by providing them with the tools to understand and carry out tasks through natural language. By incorporating advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, PrometheaLang translates diverse human-like instructions into executable code. This should make it an ideal tool for AI-driven automation, data manipulation, and web navigation tasks.
